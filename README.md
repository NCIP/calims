Welcome to the caLIMS Project!
==============================

caLIMS is an Open Source project that provides the functionalities of a
Laboratory Information Management system.

It is written in Java and requires Apache Ant for building.

The purpose of the caLIMS project is to create a Laboratory Information
Management System (LIMS) that tracks a complete laboratory workflow that uses
materials from a specimen management service (e.g. caTissue) to generate
experimental results for data repositories or data management services (e.g.
caArray).

A LIMS is software that is used to promote an accurate flow of sample and
associated experimental data to and through a laboratory to produce information
that is used to make conclusions and critical decisions.
